# Learn Go with Tests

Welcome to **Learn Go with Tests**! This repository documents my journey through [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) by [@quii](https://github.com/quii), a guide focused on teaching Go through test-driven development (TDD).

## Overview

This repository contains Go code examples, tests, and exercises completed as I follow along with each chapter and topic in the *Learn Go with Tests* guide. The goal is to build a solid understanding of Go fundamentals, develop test-driven development skills, and produce well-tested, idiomatic Go code.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/quantumburrito/learngowithtests.git
   cd learngowithtests
   ```

2. **Install Go** (if you haven’t already):  
   Follow the [official Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).

3. **Run the Tests**:
   Each folder includes its own Go files and test cases. Run the tests from the root of the repository or within specific folders:
   ```bash
   go test ./...
   ```

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by chapters/topics in *Learn Go with Tests*, with each folder representing a chapter or specific concept.

- **Chapter Folders**: Each chapter's code and tests are grouped into their respective folders for easy navigation.
- **Testing Examples**: Each file demonstrates test-driven development with examples of functions, structs, and interfaces, emphasizing TDD best practices in Go.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Basic Go Syntax and Functions**
- **Test-Driven Development in Go**
- **Structs, Methods, and Interfaces**
- **Pointers and Errors**
- **Concurrency in Go**
- **Dependency Injection**
- **Mocking and Testing Best Practices**

## Goals

- **Master Go Basics**: Learn Go's syntax, idiomatic usage, and core concepts.
- **Develop TDD Skills**: Apply TDD principles to write cleaner, well-tested Go code.
- **Document Learning**: This repository serves as both a learning log and a resource for others interested in test-driven Go development.
